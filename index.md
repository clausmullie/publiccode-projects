## [Standard for Public Code](http://standard.publiccode.net/)

The Standard for Public Code gives cities a model for building their own open source solutions to enable successful future reuse by other cities. It includes guidance for policymakers, city administrators, developers and vendors.

This is the first version, and [we welcome all your feedback](http://standard.publiccode.net/CONTRIBUTING.html).

## [Smart Cities? Public Code!](https://smartcities.publiccode.net/)

This project aims to further develop the concept of Public Code. More concretely: How should we understand Public Code, and how can we create it? What kind of technological and institutional arrangements are needed to shift towards the production of Public Code.

In a series of workshops, we want to build a network of collaborators to identify directions for the development of public code, and set up research & development projects and grant applications.

«Smart Cities? Public Code!» is a collaboration between the City of Amsterdam, the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences and Vurb.Agency.
