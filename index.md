## [Smart Cities? Public Code!](https://smartcities.publiccode.net/)

This project aims to further develop the concept of Public Code. More concretely: How should we understand Public Code, and how can we create it? What kind of technological and institutional arrangements are needed to shift towards the production of Public Code.

In a series of workshops, we want to build a network of collaborators to identify directions for the development of public code, and set up research & development projects and grant applications.

«Smart Cities? Public Code!» is a collaboration between the City of Amsterdam, the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences and Vurb.Agency.
