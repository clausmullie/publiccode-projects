# Projects and resources

Built when we discovered a need in our own [codebase stewardship practice](https://publiccode.net/codebase-stewardship/), these resources are all openly licensed. We'd love to hear how you use these.

See more of our work in the [codebases we work with](https://publiccode.net/codebases/).

## Current projects

We rely on these resources for our everyday work.

### [Standard for Public Code](http://standard.publiccode.net/)

The Standard for Public Code gives public organizations a model for building their own open source solutions to enable successful future reuse by other public organizations. It includes guidance for policymakers, managers, developers and designers.

This is a living document, and [we welcome your feedback](http://standard.publiccode.net/CONTRIBUTING.html).

### [Governance game](https://github.com/publiccodenet/governance-game)

An interactive game exploring governance of a public codebase. It helps participants reflect on what governances means for a codebase, the complexity around it, and surfaces issues worth considering during set up.

The game is also useful as a tool for visualizing how a current governance model is set up or could be changed.

## Past projects

Though our involvement with these projects has finished, we learned a lot from them. Perhaps you will too?

### [Smart Cities? Public Code!](https://smartcities.publiccode.net/) (February 2018 - April 2019)

This research project aimed to further develop the concept of public code. It explored how we should understand public code, and how could we create it. What kind of technological and institutional arrangements are needed to shift towards the production of public code?

Smart Cities? Public Code! was a collaboration between the City of Amsterdam, the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences and Vurb.Agency.

### [publiccode.yml](https://github.com/publiccodenet/publiccode.yml) (2018)

A simple, easy to use, developer-centric, public administration open source project metadata format.

Adopted by the Italian government for all new public code projects in Italy, this standard powers the [Italian national open source software catalog](https://developers.italia.it/it/software/).
